# wavlink-fedora

## About

This is an installation port for Fedora 41 Linux of the [Wavlink WL-UG6902H](https://www.wavlink.com/en_us/product/WL-UG6902H.html).
The device works (is supported) on Ubuntu 24.04, by just running the installation script provided by Wavlink ([check my Gist about this](https://gist.github.com/thehaniak/c40506846f1418f624f4f25164e62eff)).

To make it work on Fedora, follow the steps below.

### !! Disclaimer !!

**Any damage to your hardware or software is your sole responsability.
Run the steps below at your own risk.**

I have throughly tested this with the aforementioned device and distro and it worked, but I do not guarantee it will work on your settup.

## How to install

Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thehaniak/wavlink-fedora.git
cd wavlink-fedora
```


Add run permissions and run the install.sh script as root:

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

The install script will prompt you to install the EVDI driver. If you approve, it will also install the SMI USB driver and service.

If the device is not working straight away, just start the **smiusbdisplay.service**.

```bash
systemctl start smiusbdisplay.service
```

After installation, you _**shoud**_ reboot to make sure everything is working properly.

# How the installation port works

If you're too lazy to check the code ðŸ˜œ ...

1) Downloads and installs the _latest_ EVDI driver RPM from [displaylink-rpm](https://github.com/displaylink-rpm/displaylink-rpm/releases)
2) Copies the binaries (firmware and driver) to _/opt/siliconmotion_.
3) Installs systemd _smiusbdisplay.service_.

# Next steps

- Cleanup the install script.
- Make it possible to uninstall the SMI and EVDI drivers.
- Remove upstart script support, as it's no longer necessary from Fedora 41.
